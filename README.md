# GammaQuality

A single-page React app for managing releases across **Developer**, **QA**, and
**Admin** roles, backed entirely by **Supabase** (Auth, Postgres, Storage).

## Setup

1. **Install**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the database setup** — in the Supabase **SQL editor**, run all of
   [`supabase_setup.sql`](supabase_setup.sql). It creates every table
   (`profiles`, `projects`, `releases`, `bugs`, `comments`, `notifications`,
   `checklist_items`, `release_checklist`), RLS policies, the signup trigger
   (first user = Admin, `@jumppace.com` only), and the public Storage buckets
   (`apks`, `screenshots`) with upload policies.

3. **Backfill (only if you already had accounts before the tables existed)** —
   run [`backfill_existing_users.sql`](backfill_existing_users.sql).

4. **Credentials** — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
   ```

5. **Email confirmation** — for quick testing, turn it off at
   **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email → Confirm email**. The app
   handles both modes.

6. **Run**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

First account to sign up becomes **Admin**.

## Features

- **Projects** — admin-created (name, type, platform). Releases must pick one.
- **Releases** — APK download link, TestFlight link, or Web link (builds are
  shared as permanent links — WeTransfer/expiring hosts are rejected); version,
  notes, status workflow (Pending / In QA / QA Complete / Repeat Bug).
- **Bugs** — QA files bugs (title, description, severity, screenshot) with their
  own workflow (Open / In Progress / Fixed / Verified). Open-bug count badge on
  cards and a Bugs tab in the detail view.
- **Comments** — threaded discussion per release.
- **Notifications** — in-app bell; developers are notified when a bug is filed on
  their release, QA when a bug is marked fixed.
- **Checklists** — admin defines a QA checklist per project; QA must complete it
  before a release can be marked QA Complete.
- **Tester assignment** — admin assigns a QA to a release; only that tester (or
  an admin) can run QA actions on it.
- **Analytics** — per-project release count, bug count, avg submission→QA-complete
  time, repeat-bug rate.
- **History + changelog** — per-project timeline; export QA-complete releases as a
  Markdown changelog (copy or download).
